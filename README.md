## Steps I followed in this Machine Learning App Developement

### 1 Import the Data

- This often invloves the data that the model will use to learn, and therefore grow intelligence from
- This normally in the form of CSV, Data pulled from an API
  
### 2 Clean the Data
- Involves tasks e.g Removing duplicates, filling blanks, `to ensure that our model only learns correct patterns for the best results` .Can at times involve encoding from text to numerical values.
- 
### 3 Split the data into Train/Testing Sets
- Assign about 80% for Testing it and test its performance with the rest
  
### 4 Create a Model
- Involves `Selecting an Algorithm` to Analyse the imported Data
- This normally depends on the project you're doing.Examples include
    - Decision Trees
    - NN
A good Example is the `scikit-learn` library that has a lot of ML Algorithms.

### 5 Train the Model
